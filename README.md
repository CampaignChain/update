# CampaignChain Update Bundle

The update feature is a package that is included in CampaignChain by default and
can also be used independently from CampaignChain as a regular Symfony bundle.

The update package offers you the ability to include update routines in multiple
separate CampaignChain modules or Symfony bundles. Essentially, it extends the
[DoctrineMigrationsBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMigrationsBundle).

## Documentation

Documentation on how to install and use this bundle is available in the
[CampaignChain Documentation](http://docs.campaignchain.com/en/master/package/campaignchain_update.html).
